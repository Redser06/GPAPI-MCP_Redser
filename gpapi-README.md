GlobalPayments API MCP Server
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for integrating GlobalPayments APIs with AI assistants like Claude.

What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. MCP servers act as bridges between AI models and various services, allowing seamless integration of third-party APIs into AI workflows.

About This Project
This MCP server provides access to the GlobalPayments API, enabling AI assistants to interact with payment processing functionality directly through natural language conversations.

Available Implementations
This project provides two complete implementations:

Python (/Python) - Full-featured MCP server using Python
TypeScript (/Typescript) - Full-featured MCP server using TypeScript/Node.js
Both implementations offer the same functionality. Choose based on your preferred runtime environment.

Getting Started
Navigate to either the Python/ or Typescript/ directory for specific installation and usage instructions.

Configuration
Both implementations require GlobalPayments API credentials:

Access Token
Environment (sandbox or live)
